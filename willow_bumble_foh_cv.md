Over the years, I’ve worked and studied in a variety of roles and sectors. Prior to 2020, I gained experience working in cafes, bars, and event organization. During these team-oriented and public facing roles, I've proven to be trustworthy, adaptable and reliable. This includes responsibilities handling cash and locking up premises. Whilst I am quick to understand my role as part of team, I also excel working independently. Such as during lockdown and since, I’ve started my own company making clothing and video content, where I organise and create everything from the clothes to the advertising.  In general, Whilst I'm readily compliant, I'm also not afraid to use my common sense and initiative. I look forward to hearing from you and will be available for interview as soon as is convenient for you.
